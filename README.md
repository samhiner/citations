## Citations

### Situation:
https://citationstyles.org/. Apparently there are a *ton* of citation machines out there. And I randomly clicked on one and it was fast. So I guess the saying is true, everything has already been written before. However, I am going to keep working on this because I am enjoying it and I am going to change my target to being a citation machine for power-users (in line with my original goal of speed, will just take a bit more work to set up a very quick UI and lots of shortcuts). 

### Summary:
Despite you having to manually fetch information, the speed and smoothness of this program (combined with the unpredictability of the autocite on other services) has made it the preferred choice of myself and friends.

This is by no means production ready. It only works if you use it properly (I didn't worry about input validation because nothing is processed on the backend).

### Features:
- Way faster and smoother than other programs
- No ads or popups

### Planned Features:
- Automatically gather information for your citation (and make sure this doesn't destroy speed).
- Automatically set page margins when pasted into Google Docs
- Input validation
- More appealing interface (as long as it doesn't slow the software down)
- Google Docs extension
- Keep multiple citations on the site which are automatically alphabetized

### Not Planning To Support (aka where other services beat this):
- Integrated grammar/plagiarism checking
- Vast number of different citation styles (actually probably will do this soon because I just found a library but I am leaving it here for now to be safe).

### Errors
- For Reuters, it gives "U.S." (or other country prob) for website name
